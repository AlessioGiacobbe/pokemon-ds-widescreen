// ssrecomp: where helper threads (the 3D render thread, the widescreen drawing threads) run.
//
// On the Nintendo Switch a new thread stays on the process's default core, core 0, which is
// where the emulation itself runs, unless it moves itself: Horizon does not spread threads
// over the cores as a desktop system does. So each helper thread calls this first and moves
// to cores 1 and 2 (core 3 belongs to the system).
//
// Horizon also does not share a core between threads of the same priority by time: one runs
// until it waits. The emulation waits for the DS-resolution 3D thread line by line, so with
// the JIT (which leaves the emulation waiting for it 3-9 ms a frame when it queued behind a
// widescreen thread) that thread has core 1 to itself at a higher priority than the
// widescreen threads, which take cores 2 and 1 and give way to it.
// The widescreen threads may also use core 0, at the lowest priority there is: while the
// emulation waits (for the DS-resolution 3D or for the widescreen picture itself) core 0 has
// nothing else to do, and Horizon moves a thread that is ready but kept waiting on its own
// core (behind the 3D thread on core 1, or the main thread drawing on core 2) to a core that
// sits idle. A third widescreen thread starts on core 0. "wide_core0=0" in ssrecomp.cfg keeps
// them off it (SSR_WIDE_CORE0=0), for comparing.
// Elsewhere this does nothing.

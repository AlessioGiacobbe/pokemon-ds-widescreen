// ssrecomp: widescreen, full-resolution rendering of the 3D scene.
//
// The DS draws its 3D scene 256x192 pixels large through a 4:3 view. For a wide display
// the frame's polygons are submitted a second time with the horizontal clip coordinate
// squeezed, so that what lies left and right of the original view survives clipping, and
// are then drawn by a separate rasteriser at the size of the output. The emulated state
// is not touched: the game sees exactly the polygon counts and results it would see
// without any of this.

# Changelog

## v0.2.1 — 64-bit ARM Linux

**Downloads:** `ssrecomp-setup-linux-x86_64`,
`ssrecomp-setup-linux-aarch64.AppImage` (64-bit ARM Linux: Raspberry Pi 4/5
with a 64-bit OS, other arm64 boards and laptops) and
`ssrecomp-setup-windows-x86_64.exe` are setup programs, not the game: start
one, choose your own Pokémon SoulSilver (US) ROM, press Build, then Play. Use
these instead of the v0.2.0 ones.

### New

- **Setup program for 64-bit ARM Linux**, as an AppImage
  (`tools/make_appimage.sh`). The game compiles for arm64; cross-compiled and
  run under emulation it is identical to the x86 build frame for frame. Not yet
  tried on real ARM hardware.

### Fixed

- **The game would not compile on ARM, and would crash on older x86 CPUs**: the
  widescreen renderer was always built with AVX2 instructions. They are now
  used only on x86 CPUs that have them; nothing changes on those.
- The recompiler failed when its output folder was on another drive.

### Known limitations

- Windows and ARM builds not yet tried on real hardware (Windows under Wine,
  ARM under emulation).
- See v0.2.0 and v0.1.0 for the rest.

## v0.2.0 — build from your own ROM

**Downloads:** `ssrecomp-setup-linux-x86_64` and
`ssrecomp-setup-windows-x86_64.exe` are setup programs, not the game: start
one, choose your own Pokémon SoulSilver (US) ROM, press Build, then Play. A
compiler and a few libraries are needed; the program says which and how to get
them. A ready-built game cannot be offered, as it would contain the game's code.

### New

- **Setup programs for Linux and Windows**: one file each, made from this
  release's source (`tools/package_setup.py`). They carry the project's source
  and build the game in a folder of their own.
- **Setup window** (`ssrecomp_setup.py`): pick your ROM, press Build, press
  Play. It checks the ROM is the right game, says what is missing to compile
  and how to install it, picks the number of compile jobs from your memory, and
  shows the progress. `python3 ssrecomp_setup.py --rom <file>` does the same
  without a window.
- **No decompilation needed to play.** The code is recompiled straight from
  your ROM (`tools/ndsrom.py` reads and decompresses it); what the
  decompilation used to add comes from `layouts/soulsilver-us.json`, which holds
  addresses and checksums only. The result is identical to building from the
  decompilation. `setup.sh` remains for working on the game's source.
- **Windows (untested):** the code compiles with MinGW, and the setup window
  supports MSYS2 and copies the needed DLLs next to the game. Not yet tried on
  a Windows machine.

### Known limitations

- Tested on Linux only (Ubuntu 24.04 in a container on Bazzite).
- Only Pokémon SoulSilver (US).
- See v0.1.0 for the rest.

## v0.1.0 — first preview

The first public version. Playable from the start of a new game through the
early routes, towns and gyms; the rest of the game has not been played through
with it yet.

**No ready-made download.** A built program would contain the game's code, so
releases are source only: run `./setup.sh` with your own copy of Pokémon
SoulSilver (US) as described in the README.

### What's in it

- **Static recompilation** of the game's ARM9 code from pret/pokeheartgold's
  build output, running on the melonDS core. Checked against melonDS's
  interpreter instruction by instruction (`--lockstep`).
- **One screen, no switching.** Each situation has its own layout that takes the
  useful parts of both DS screens: the overworld with dialogue, the X menu beside
  the overworld, the bag, party, Pokédex, Pokégear, PC, shops, the intro and the
  starter choice.
- **Widescreen overworld:** the 3D world is drawn across the whole 16:9 view at
  a higher resolution (540–1440 lines, "WORLD DETAIL" in the pause menu); trees
  and buildings at the sides are drawn instead of popping in.
- **Battles across the whole screen**, with the touch-screen buttons as a strip
  along the bottom: FIGHT / BAG / POKéMON / RUN and the four moves, chosen with
  left and right, A to pick, B to go back.
- **60 fps:** in-between frames for the 3D scene, which the game updates 30
  times a second.
- **Controller first:** everything is reachable with buttons; a pause menu (Guide
  button or Esc) holds the settings, save states and fast forward.
- **Runs well:** about 9 ms of a 16.7 ms frame at 2560×1440 on a 6-core desktop
  CPU; the picture is composed on the graphics card.
- **`setup.sh`** installs what is missing, builds the game with the
  decompilation, checks it against the retail ROM's SHA-1 and compiles
  everything in one step.

### Known limitations

- Linux only so far (tested on Ubuntu 24.04 in a container on Bazzite).
  Windows, macOS and Android builds do not exist yet.
- Only Pokémon SoulSilver (US). HeartGold and other regions are not supported.
- Later parts of the game, and some screens (radio, contests, the Pokéathlon,
  wireless features), have not been checked and may show a generic two-screen
  layout.
- The widescreen picture has no edge-marking outlines; battles, menus and the
  intro stay 4:3 apart from the battle sides.
- The recompiled code is not yet faster than melonDS's own interpreter; making
  it so is future work.
